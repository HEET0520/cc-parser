Payment of any amount lesser than the Total Amount Due in any month would result in interest accrual on the balance outstanding amount including any new purchases or cash advances. Furthermore, making only the minimum payment every month would result in the repayment stretching over years with consequent interest payment on your outstanding balance. Failure to pay Minimum Amount Due would also lead to adverse reporting against the cardholder with all credit bureaus. Transactions/balances converted into instalments or any credits received after the card statement generated shall be excluded from Total Amount Due. HoweveCURR , it is mandatory to make Minimum Amount Due payment to avoid financial charges and keep your credit card in good standing. Following tax rates are applicable for all fees and charges: IGST @18%, CGST @9% and SGST @9%.
